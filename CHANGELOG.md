## [0.0.1] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Monorepo folder skeleton (`src/`, `packages/`, `ops/`, `deploy/`) as designed in `docs/infrastructure/build-system.md` (0.T1)
- `CHANGELOG.md` and the README operations-manual stub sections
- Project-specific `.gitignore` entries (frontend, backup archives, generated files) and root-anchored `lib/` so SvelteKit's `src/lib` is not ignored
