# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Every PR carries exactly one version bump and one entry here (1 MVP = 1 PR = 1 version); the owner tags `vX.Y.Z` at merge.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Dev container (`.devcontainer/`): Python 3.12 + Poetry, Node 22 + npm, git, Docker CLI + Compose plugin, GitHub CLI (0.T2)
- docker-outside-of-docker socket mount; named volume so `gh` auth survives container rebuilds; tolerant post-create that activates by itself once the toolchain files land (1.B1, 1.F1)
- `.gitattributes` forcing LF on `*.sh` (scripts run inside Linux containers; a CRLF checkout on Windows must never reach them)

## [0.0.1] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Monorepo folder skeleton (`src/`, `packages/`, `ops/`, `deploy/`) as designed in `docs/infrastructure/build-system.md` (0.T1)
- `CHANGELOG.md` and the README operations-manual stub sections
- Project-specific `.gitignore` entries (frontend, backup archives, generated files) and root-anchored `lib/` so SvelteKit's `src/lib` is not ignored
